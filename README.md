# tgc-webgl
An open source 3D graphics framework made in Javascript with _WebGL_ and [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js).

## Instructions

### Running the project

#### Firefox

Clone the project and drag `index.html` to Firefox. You are ready to load your projects.

#### Chrome

Clone the project, install [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) and select your cloned project folder as the server folder (using _CHOOSE FOLDER_).

#### Other browsers

Support on other browsers is currently unstable. You may try to run your `index.html` locally and if it supports local file fetching you may need a local server (check your console for details, if it says something like 'CORS request' you need a server).

### Finding projects

You may find available projects by using `Projects.list();` on the console.

### Loading projects

You can load projects by using `Projects.load("your-project-name");` on the console.
